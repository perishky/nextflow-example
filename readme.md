## Nextflow example for toy methyl-seq data

Aims to demonstrate roughly how a nextflow pipeline
could be set up for methyl-seq data.

'Download' the data (actually simulates data)
```
nextflow run nextflow-example/download.nf
```

Perform the analyses
```
nextflow run nextflow-example/main.nf 
```
